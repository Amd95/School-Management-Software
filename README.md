    - Setting Up the Project
    - Adding Code to the Generated Source File
    - Compiling and Running the Application
    - Building and Deploying the Application
    - Next Steps

- [JDK](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
    - Which stand for Java Development Kit, which help us to develop, text, protype, and demonstrate JAVA Apps.
